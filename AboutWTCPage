                            World Tree Circle is a grassroots organization that is dedicated 
                            to connecting people on a global scale through news channels and 
                            social media.  It’s an international non-profit organization.  
                            World Tree Circle wishes to create a social media website that will 
                            feature user profiles, an active news feed that can be searched 
                            through and updated, a dynamic question and answer forum where any 
                            type of question can be asked, as well as a unique translation tool 
                            that allows users to contribute to the translation for any language 
                            they know and then monitored by moderators to make sure that 
                            translation is correct and swift.

                            World Tree Circle’s website will provide users with a place to interact, 
                            learn, and have fun on a global scale. It will be a place that people 
                            can share interesting ideas and expand their own ideas.  World Tree 
                            Circle is unique in that it will provide user-friendly tools to 
                            communicate across language and cultural barriers. The site will be open 
                            sourced in order to provide the most rapid responses to user feedback 
                            that the site will acquire. To do this we are constantly gathering data 
                            on existing social media websites as well as gathering our own data to 
                            create a site that caters to everyone. We created a survey to be sent out, 
                            looked at trends, investigated other popular social media, as well as 
                            constructed a focus group to help us gather the necessary information to 
                            build an optimal website.  We continue to work with the local college, 
                            Western Carolina University, as a part of this process.
