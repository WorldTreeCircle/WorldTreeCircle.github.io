<p>World Tree Circle, aka WTC, is the brain child of Clarke Ball. It started out as a website where people can gather to meet and chat with people around the world, whether they spoke the language, knew anyone there to begin with or not. Or, simply wanted to travel there and acquire information from the locals. Unlike other social media websites, the purpose of this site is to enable people to communicate across language and social boundaries. The user has less restrictions regarding making friends.

With the help of Craig's List, Clarke put together a team of web designers, program managers, and marketers to help create the site since he and his wife had very little computer knowledge. With this new team we endeavored to meet the challenges that arose and the site became much more complex. For the better, I assure you! The site will include translation software, a place for artists of all media to show and sell their wares, as well as a place for organizations to expound on their activities around the planet. All of this will be posted on what WTC calls their "leaves". If you are familiar with social networking, "leaves" are similar to a profile page. Due to the scope, and lack of funding for such a complex site, the progress stalled and the team has shrunk just a little. We parted friends and still try to help one another out in our individual endeavors.

Todays crew is still trying to get the idea out there. Clarke wants this to be a success. Not for his own gain, but because he believes it is important to all of us. He has created this blog to share the idea with the goal of open sourcing WorldTreeCircle.com and allowing all the great minds around the world to add to its creation.

Comments, suggestions, ideas, and ALL input is welcomed and encouraged. In this modern world of technology our possibilities, once almost limitless, have become infinite. Let's share all our strengths and creativity and become everything we are meant to be.

Welcome to World Tree Circle!
